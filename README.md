Decker game, from 2001, made by Shawn Overcash. Remade in Javascript in 2018 by Palparepa.

This project aims to add different options to the game, specifically the ICE Memory mode. It also seeks to rebalance the
different contracts that are available and add a new type of contract, Silence Alert, where the player enters an already
hostile network and needs to silence the alert.
